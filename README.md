# Wireshark-for-Basic-Network-Security-Analysis

Project Structure
The hands on project on Wireshark for Basic Network Security Analysis is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Get to know Wireshark and its basic functionalities

Task 2: Generate and Capture RADIUS Traffic

Task 3: Analyze a HTTP Basic Authentication

Task 4: HTTP Form-Based Authentication and DNS

Task 5: Initiate, Capture and Analyze Telnet Sessions

Task 6: Capturing and Analyzing SSH Sessions

Task 7: Generate, Capture, Analyze then Decrypt HTTPS Traffic

Analysis
Now we will build (project goals). We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Using Wireshark and most of its basic functionalities: capturing some network traffic that is flowing through your machine now and analyzing already captured network traffic by opening a stored capture file.No items assigned

Generating and capturing RADIUS Traffic, analyzing it and viewing it in Wireshark. Knowing what the RADIUS Architecture consists of and decrypting the encrypted password with the shared secret using Wireshark.No items assigned

Knowing the basics about HTTP, and knowing the difference between Wiresharkâ€™s Capture and Display Filters. Connecting to an HTTP Server and initiate a Basic HTTP Authentication and capturing its Traffic on Wireshark, analyzing the captured packets and seeing the username and password being sent.No items assigned

Initiating an HTTP Form-based authentication, capturing it in Wireshark and analyzing it so you can see the username and password clearly. Also Capturing DNS Traffic.No items assigned

Knowing how Telnet works, starting a Telnet Session with a remote Device using Powershell, capturing its traffic in Wireshark and analyzing it from the Security perspective.No items assigned

Opening a SSH Session with the same Device as in Task 5, capturing the traffic and comparing it with the Telnet Packet Capture. Capturing traffic based on the host involved and how to see all the host, packet and protocol statistics as well as conversations that have happened in a certain Capture.No items assigned
